Negative indexing
- Python arrays & list items can be accessed with positive or negative numbers (also known as index).
- For instance our array/list is of size n, then for positive index 0 is the first index, 1 second, last index will be n-1. For negative index, -n is the first index, -(n-1) second, last negative index will be – 1.
- A negative index accesses elements from the end of the list counting backwards.


Packing and UnPacking
- Consider a situation when we don’t know how many arguments need to be passed to a python function, we can use Packing to pack all arguments in a tuple and then use it according to our convenience.
- Consider a function which takes 3 arguments and we have a list of size 3 with us that has all arguments for the function. If we simply pass list to the function, the call doesn’t work.


Mutable and Immutable
- These are of type list, dict, set . Custom classes are generally mutable.
- These are of in-built types like int, float, bool, string, unicode, tuple. In simple words, an immutable object can’t be changed after it is created.


Append and Extend
- Adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list. The length of the list increases by one.
- Iterates over its argument and adding each element to the list and extending the list. The length of the list increases by number of elements in it’s argument.


Pickling and Unpickling
- The process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream.
- The inverse operation, whereby a byte stream is converted back into an object hierarchy.
